gnokiid TODO...

25 June 1999

This initial commit of the source files for gnokiid and the AT emulation
code is just that - an initial commit.  Please don't send patches
for it yet as there are more holes than not!!

The only command supported is ATE - echo on/off, not very exciting
but it will give a feel for what is to come.

There are lots of bugs and holes, most notably both the pty and stdin
input routines are still cooked so they only generate a signal when
a CR/LF is sent.  Thus it doesn't look quite like a real modem yet!
