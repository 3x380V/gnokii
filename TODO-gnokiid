gnokiid TODO...

27 June 1999

This is the second commit of the source files for gnokiid and the virtual
modem code.

The only commands supported are ATE - echo on/off and AT+CSQ, not very
exciting but it will give a feel for what is to come.

There are lots of bugs and holes, most notably both the pty and stdin
input routines are still cooked so they only generate a signal when
a CR/LF is sent.  Thus it doesn't look quite like a real modem yet!
