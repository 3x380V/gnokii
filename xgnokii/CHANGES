- Fixed error in FB61_GetMemoryStatus. (FB61_GetMemoryStatus had ignore all
  error status except GE_TIMEOUT. This break Contacts memory reading for
  phone with only SIM memory.)
  I think that Contacts memory reading is working also in 38xx series, but I
  can't test it.

- Import from file is working. Xgnokii uses extended format from NCDS (with
  group entry) and is capable reading NCDS files.
