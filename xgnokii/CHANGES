Changes in Options window:
- Added User information edit window (needed for Business Card).
- Added SMS settings windows. Xgnokii can only read SMS centers numbers from
  phone. I can't read SMS set name, SMS format and Validity period from phone.
  I can't also write any SMS setting in phone. And I don't know differencies
  between SMS formats. :(
- Added Groups names edit window. I can change group names in xgnokii. But
  I can't read or write group names from/to phone because I don't have support
  in gnokii. 
- Added Alarm window. Xgnokii can read alarm from phone and set alarm in
  phone. It can't unset alarm because lack support in gnokii.
Changes in Contacts window:
- Added Voice dial function.
- Allowed sort order changing by clicking on titles.
- Removed bug, when contacts in SIM card was not removed from phone, when
  deleted in xgnokii.

- Fixed error in FB61_GetMemoryStatus. (FB61_GetMemoryStatus had ignore all
  error status except GE_TIMEOUT. This break Contacts memory reading for
  phone with only SIM memory.)
  I think that Contacts memory reading is working also in 38xx series, but I
  can't test it.
Changes in Contacts window:
- Export to file is working.
- Import from file is working. Xgnokii uses extended format from NCDS (with
  group entry) and is capable reading NCDS files.
