This is a to-do list for 6110 series.

- writing documentation of the protocol

- check out errors when reading and writing phonebook entries!!!

- delete all FIXME from the sources

- implement calendar notes infrastructure and --getcalendarnote, --writecalendarnote

- implement function FB61_GetStatus which should return {"Waiting for PIN",
  "Registered within the network", "Call in progress" ...}

- X interface :-)

- second part of SMS notification is not handled now...

- generic timeout checking routine which gets these params: timeout,
  CurrentErrorSomething... it should wait at most timeout/10 seconds but if
  the variable CurrentErrorSomething changes state from GE_BUSY to something
  else it should return.
