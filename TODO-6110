This is a to-do list for 6110 series.

- sending SMS messages

- writing documentation of the protocol

- how do we answer the incoming call (aka ATA?)

- check out errors when reading phonebook entries

- delete all FIXME from the sources

- implement correct settime function - it should be very easy

- implement calendar notes infrastructure and --getcalendarnote

- --writecalendarnote

- implement function FB61_GetStatus which should return {"Waiting for PIN",
  "Registered within the network", "Call in progress" ...}

- phonebook group handling

- X interface :-)
