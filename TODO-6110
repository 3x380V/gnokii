This is a to-do list for 6110 series.

- writing documentation of the protocol

- check out errors when reading and writing phonebook entries

- delete all FIXME from the sources

- implement calendar notes infrastructure and --getcalendarnote, --writecalendarnote

- implement function FB61_GetStatus which should return {"Waiting for PIN",
  "Registered within the network", "Call in progress" ...}

- X interface :-)

- carefully check incoming packets so we can not crash if the mouse is
  repeating our bytes on the serial interface (i.e. checksums and
  source/destination fields)

- second part of SMS notification is not handled now...

- support for Nokia CDS's phonebook files

- MemoryType should be in GSM_PhonebookEntry and GSM_SMSMessages

- DeleteSMS error checking

- SendSMSMessage error checking

- generic timeout checking routine which gets these params: timeout,
  CurrentErrorSomething... it should wait at most timeout/10 seconds but if
  the variable CurrentErrorSomething changes state from GE_BUSY to something
  else it should return.

- GMT_SIM and GMT_INTERNAL central parsing - this is done in each
  function...

- how NCDS saves names with ";" in it?

- PIN request should be fixed
