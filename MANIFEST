gnokii.c
    A primative front end to allow gnokii/gsm-api functions
    to be used.  This will be replaced with something far
    cooler RSN.

gsm-api.c	
	Provides high level API to a GSM phone.  Relies on code
	in other modules (fbus-3810.c/.h for example) to provide
	actual functions themselves.

gsm-api.h
	Header file for the above, mainly provides prototypes
	and some standard defines.  Should be included into application
	source code.

gsm-common.h
	Header file that defines structures, enums etc. used
	by both the gsm-api functions and (often) the underlying
	model specific code.  Should be included into application
	source code.

	The actual functions provided by the gsm-api are stored
    in a structure in this file.

misc.h
	Header file containing miscellaneous defines.

fbus-3810.c
	Code specific to the 3110/3810/8110 models that provides
	the functionality called via gsm-api.c.  Is also full of 
	functions used internally as one might expect.

fbus-3810.h
	Header file for the above, provides prototypes for
	the various functions in the .c file as well as 3810 specific
	defines, enums etc.  This source file (ordinarily) should
	not be included in actual application code.

fbus-6110.c/fbus-6110.h
    Starting point source code for 6110 series support.
